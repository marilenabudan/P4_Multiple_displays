##Â Practice 4

The Roll a ball game has been adapted to the requirements of practice 4: 
- A setup to render the image in a panoramic display:
Left and right cameras are configured to be displayed on two displays (display 1 and 2) of fixed size to 16:9

- Implement a mini map camera that shows the game from the top view:
It is placed on top of the second display of the panoramic view. 

- Implement a render texture in an object in the scene from the view of a second camera:
The render texture acts like a mirror on the game.
